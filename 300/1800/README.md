# 1800 - Run yarn install --mode update-lockfile in root

From within the root of the repository at https://github.com/creations-global/frame run the following command:

```
$ yarn install --mode update-lockfile
```

This will create and/or update the required ```yarn.lock``` file which is needed by our GitHub Action later on.
