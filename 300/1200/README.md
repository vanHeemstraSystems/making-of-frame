## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use https://creations.global/vulnz to report security vulnerabilities.

We use https://creations.global/vulnz for our intake and triage. For valid issues we will do
coordination and disclosure here on GitHub (including using a GitHub Security
Advisory when necessary).

The Frame Security Team will process your report within a day, and respond
within a week (although it will depend on the severity of your report).
