Our Github Actions workflow with automatically build a package from the source code and publish it to npm.

You can see the latest releases in the Github repository at https://github.com/creations-global/frame/releases

After a successful publish of the package to npm, you can view the package on npmjs.com by entering the following in the search on https://npmjs.com:

```
@creationsglobal/frame
```

**NOTE**: On npm the organization name is not creations-global, but creationsglobal (as creations-global was no longer available).

Or go directly to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@creationsglobal/frame

To install the node module package use the following:

```
$ npm i @creationsglobal/frame
```
